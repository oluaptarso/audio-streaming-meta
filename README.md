# Audio Streaming

Audio Streaming is an application developed for testing/learning purposes.
<br />

The web application has three core functionalities:
- Fetch and display the available music from the API;
- The player, which allows the user to play, pause, mute/unmute, and control the time;
- Control the playlist, adding, removing, and reordering the music on the playlist.

The API has two core endpoints:
- List the available music;
- Streaming music.
